* Perform requests
* AWS errors

* 60s DNS cache (?)

* Follow redirects
* retry on failures, with exponential backoff
  (possibility to disable for interactive usages)
* Automatically retrieve credentials from instance role?
  ==> getting credentials should be asynchronous
* Request performance:
  - DNS caching
  - keepalive
  - TLS session resumption
